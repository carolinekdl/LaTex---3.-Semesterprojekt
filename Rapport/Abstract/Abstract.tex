The purpose of this project is to design and develope an invasive blood pressure measurement system, that consists of a user-friendly interface. The project also includes the work of having a system that should be able to calibrate, continuously display and measure blood pressure and pulse rate. The system will be able to alert with an alarm if the blood pressure rises or falls. In addition, the program consists of a digital filter for filtering the blood pressure. As something new in this project, we had the opportunity to build our own hardware, in the form a printed circuit board, in our system. 

The group decided to aim at designing a system that fits inside an operating theatre. This user-situation has made a big impact on the groups' decision-making regarding design and functions, as well as how the work has been prioritized. The user of the blood pressure system, who is the healthcare staff, can through the interface save data as a file. 
Work has been prioritized based on the MoSCoW-model [X]. This prototype therefor fulfills the prescribed must-have criteria regarding: color size, size of values and ect. 

The group work is based on the SCRUM-method and the ASE-model. Apart from that, our group were divided into respectively, software and hardware group
