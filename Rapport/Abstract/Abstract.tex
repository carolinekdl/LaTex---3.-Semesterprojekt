The purpose of this project is to design and develope an invasive blood pressure measurement system, that consists of a user-friendly interface. The project also includes the work of having a system that should be able to calibrate, continuously display blood pressure and measure heart rate. The system will be able to alert with an alarm if the blood pressure rises or falls. In addition, the program consists of a digital filter for filtering the blood pressure.

The group decided to aim at designing a system that fits inside an operating theater. This user-situation has made a big impact on the groups' decision-making regarding design and functions, as well as how the work has been prioritized. The user of the blood pressure system, who is the healthcare staff,  can through the interface save and retrieve data from a private database. 
Work has been prioritized based on the MoSCoW-model [X]. This prototype therefor fulfills the prescribed must-have criteria regarding: color size, size of values and ect.
